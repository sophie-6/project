    <h3>...I love you more than words can say. </h3>
    <p>Dear Jack, </p>
    <p>
        Can you believe it's already been a whole year!? And even though you fell for me first, we both know that I fell for you harder. <br>
        And I'm still falling - into your arms as you hold me tightly, or into your gaze that holds me captive. 
        Every sensation from you - every touch, every kiss, every hug, every cuddle - brings an irreplacable feeling of safety and security. 
        Even the ghost of your kisses on my forehead bring me comfort late at night.
        You're a constant reminder that I'm not alone; that I will never have to be alone again. <br>

        You remind be that I am so grateful for being able to love - and be loved - by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are so gorgeous both inside and out. You're like the night sky - always there, always beautiful.
        The stars twinkle like your eyes when I look into them, the moon glows like your smile when I see you, and the navy blue is deep and rich like your heart.
        Sometimes at night I like to go outside, and I used to think how endlessly pretty the stars were, but now I see you in them. 
        Slight breezes brush past me like your fingers through my hair and the moonlight washes over like your soothing voice.
    </p>
    <p>   
        I used to wish on shooting stars, and now I know they really do come true. <br>

        I used to dream of love, but I don't need to anymore. <br>

        My dreams have come true, and they are you.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter what fights we have, no matter what challenges we face, I will always love you. <br>
        I will always be here for you as you have for me. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I finally understand the meaning of how loving someone until it hurts will never hurt as much as never getting to love them at all. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I love you so much, Jack. <br>
        I love that I am yours, and you are mine. <br>
        I love you - forever and always. <br>
    </p>
